to run a perl file from the bash:

sh
file.pl

breakcsvtopline.pl lists and prints the parameters of the top line of the gaiasource1 data csv file

breakcsv4.pl fills in arrays of each line and prints a single parameter.

next goal is to read the whole gaiasource1.csv as a perl hash % and start investigating the data.
